# Glossary (GLOS)
#
# Purpose:
#   Central glossary for the Stress in Action Wearables App.
#   Contains definitions and abbreviations for all variables,
#   signals, and parameters shown in tables and filters.
#
# Structure:
#   GLOS <- list(A = div(...), B = div(...), ... Z = div(...))
#   Each letter groups terms alphabetically for Shiny rendering.
#
# Usage:
#   - Displayed via “Table Information” buttons and glossary modals.
#   - Loaded in global.R as:
#         GLOS <- readRDS("data/GLOS.rds")
#
# Notes:
#   - Stored separately as data/GLOS.rds to keep global.R compact.
#   - Updated when new variables or signals are added.

# Glossary Codebook Export (df_codebook)
#
# Purpose:
#   Converts the Shiny glossary object (glos) into a simple, flat
#   codebook table that can be reused elsewhere (e.g., search, QA,
#   documentation, exports).
#
# What it does:
#   - Iterates over each letter in the glossary (A–Z).
#   - Extracts the text from <p> tags inside the stored HTML/Tag objects.
#   - Produces a long-format data frame with:
#       Letter = glossary letter (A, B, C, ...)
#       Term   = one extracted paragraph / term description per row
#   - Ensures letters with no content are still present (Term = NA).
#
# Structure:
#   df_codebook <- data.frame(
#     Letter = character(),
#     Term   = character()
#   )
#
# Stress in Action 2025
